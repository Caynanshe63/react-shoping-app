        This application is a simple and easy-to-use shopping cart system. You can browse
        products, add them to your cart, and manage your items in real time.

        The main goal of this project is to practice React concepts such as components,
        state management, and updating the cart instantly when products are added or removed.

        It is built to demonstrate how a basic online store works, including product listing,
        cart updates, and displaying total prices.
